# TODO testing premise:

consider r/100pushups and r/MakeupAddiction. if 'get_submissions' for each returns the following links:
http://www.reddit.com/r/100pushups/comments/1v1wvy/i_just_finished_the_initial_test_and_am_ready_to/
http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/1jwg3o/159_including_shipping_for_12_assorted_eye_liners/

we'll add the users u/I_love_pugs_dammit and u/ohsookie

if 'get submissions for users' returns (at least) this link:

http://www.reddit.com/r/pugs/comments/zjna4/after_years_of_lurking_i_created_an_account/

we have an edge between the two. (the submission is created y I_love_pugs_dammit and commented on
by ohsookie, also I_love_pugs_dammit replies to ohsookie.)
